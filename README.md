# Cluster-Sampling-Design-Simulator-RShiny
An R Shiny application developed under Sampling 2 to determine the required number of clusters for population mean estimation, incorporating sampling bias, survey cost, survey time, and experimental design visualization.

Overview

This repository contains an R Shiny application developed as part of an asynchronous academic assignment (Sampling 2).
The application focuses on cluster sampling for estimating the population mean and determining the required number of clusters under practical constraints.

Key Features

Cluster sampling framework for population mean estimation

Determination of required number of clusters

Incorporation of sampling bias

Estimation of total survey cost and time

Design of experiment visualization (Cost vs Time plot)

Interactive parameter control using R Shiny

Prerequisites

To run this application, install the following:

install.packages("shiny")
